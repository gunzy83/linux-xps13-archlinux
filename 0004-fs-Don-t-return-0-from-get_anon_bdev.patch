Subject: [PATCH 04/10] fs: Don't return 0 from get_anon_bdev
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Commit 9e30cc9595303b27b48 removed an internal mount. This
has the side-effect that rootfs now has FSID 0. Many
userspace utilities assume that st_dev in struct stat
is never 0, so this change breaks a number of tools in
early userspace.

Since we don't know how many userspace programs are affected,
make sure that FSID is at least 1.
